## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Styles not loading properly  
**Solution:** Ensure the CSS is properly linked (in this embedded version, it's within style tags)

**Issue:** Contact form not working  
**Note:** This is HTML/CSS only - for a functioning form, you would need to add backend functionality or use a form service.

**Issue:** Layout looks broken on mobile  
**Solution:** Check that the viewport meta tag is present and consider adding more media queries for smaller screens
